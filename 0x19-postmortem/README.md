Postmortem: Unexpected Banana Avalanche Incident
##############Issue Summary##############

Duration: April 12, 2024, 10:00 AM to April 13, 2024, 2:30 AM (UTC)

##############Impact##############
 The Banana Delivery Service (BDS) experienced a catastrophic failure, resulting in a 100% outage for all users.

##############Root Cause##############
 An unexpected banana avalanche occurred in the BDS warehouse, overwhelming our infrastructure and causing widespread disruption.

########################Timeline########################

10:00 AM: Issue detected when the BDS monitoring system triggered an alert due to a sudden drop in banana throughput.
10:15 AM: Engineers noticed a strange rustling sound near the banana storage area.
10:30 AM: Investigation began, focusing on potential monkey-related incidents.
11:00 AM: Misleading path: We suspected a rogue monkey gang had tampered with the banana conveyor belts.
12:00 PM: Escalated incident to the “Fruit Emergency Response Team” (FERT).
1:00 PM: FERT discovered the true cause: an unstable banana pyramid had collapsed, triggering the avalanche.
2:00 PM: Resolved the immediate crisis by clearing the banana debris and restoring the conveyor belts.

###############Root Cause and Resolution###############

Cause: The banana avalanche resulted from poor banana stacking practices. Our automated stacking algorithm failed to account for the inherent slipperiness of bananas.

Resolution: We implemented a new stacking algorithm that considers banana peel friction and adjusts stacking angles accordingly. Additionally, we reinforced the banana pyramid foundations with duct tape.
Corrective and Preventative Measures
Banana Avalanche Drills: Regular drills for employees to practice emergency banana avalanche response.
Banana Peel Detection System: Install sensors to detect slippery banana peels on conveyor belts.
Monkey Surveillance: Increase security to prevent monkey mischief.
Banana Safety Training: Mandatory training for all BDS staff on proper banana handling techniques.
Banana Avalanche Insurance: Investigate insurance options for future banana-related incidents.

In conclusion, we’ve learned that even the humble banana can wreak havoc when mishandled. Let’s stay vigilant and keep our banana infrastructure stable
